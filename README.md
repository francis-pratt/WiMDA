# WiMDA
Windows muon data analysis

WiMDA is Francis Pratt's Muon Data Analysis Program for Windows Computers
 
The current version of the WiMDA executable is version 1.314 (04/02/22) and is found under downloads/currentwimda/wimda.exe 

For a new installation follow the Installation Notes, install.md, which provides details and links for installation, 
together with links to further programs that are needed to use the full plotting, fitting and data access functions of WiMDA.

Basic instructions for using the program are given in the original WiMDA manual 
(please note that this corresponds a rather older version and some details may have changed).

Latest features:

  allows for suffix after run number in the naming of PSI mon files

  modelling of detector deadtime correction

  reads HAL9500 data stored in MDU format

  more phase correction options for Fourier transform mode including automatic

  user fitting libraries can use free Lazarus IDE for Free Pascal Compiler

  up to six fitting components in analyse mode

  reads NEXUS v1 and v2 muon data files

  runs under Windows versions XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 10, either native or in virtual machine

  stdcall fit libraries for mixed language compatibility

  extra options for count loss correction

  support for Red/Green and periods mode 

  option to use averaged log temperatures in fit tables

  data simulation

  laser logging

  rotating reference frame display


Raw data formats currently recognised by WiMDA:

  ISIS: NEXUS, MACS and MCS format, i.e.current and archived data from MUSR/EMU/DEVA/HIFI/ARGUS/CHRONUS

  PSI: BIN format from GPS/LTF/GPD/DOLLY, MDU format from HAL9500, LEM data via conversion to BIN format

  KEK: pi port and mu port

  TRIUMF: TRI format

Versions currently expire after 24 months; users should download a newer version at least every 24 months to keep up with bug fixes and new features.

A paper on WiMDA with screenshots was presented at the MUSR99 conference in Les Diablerets (August 30th - September 3rd 1999) and provides an overview of the program (see doc folder).

Please cite this paper as F.L. Pratt, Physica B 289-290, 710 (2000) when you refer to the use of the WiMDA data analysis program in a publication.
