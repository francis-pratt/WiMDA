# WiMDA
WiMDA stands for Windows Muon Data Analysis

This is Francis Pratt's Muon Data Analysis Program for Windows Computers
 
The current version of the WiMDA executable is version 1.314 (04/02/22), downloadable <a href=download/currentwimda/wimda.exe >here</a> 

For a new installation follow the Installation Notes, <a href=install.md >install.md</a>, which provides details and links for installation, 
together with links to further programs that are needed for adding user fitting functions to WiMDA.

Basic instructions for using the program are given in the original <a href="doc/WiMDA Manual.doc" >WiMDA manual</a><br> 
(please note that this corresponds to a rather old version and some details may have changed).

Latest features: <br>
  &ensp; allows for suffix after run number in the naming of PSI mon files <br>
  &ensp; modelling of detector deadtime correction <br>
  &ensp; reads HAL9500 data stored in MDU format <br>
  &ensp; more phase correction options for Fourier transform mode including automatic <br>
  &ensp; user fitting libraries can use free Lazarus IDE for Free Pascal Compiler <br>
  &ensp; up to six fitting components in analyse mode <br>
  &ensp; reads NEXUS v1 and v2 muon data files <br>
  &ensp; runs under Windows versions XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 10, either native or in virtual machine <br>
  &ensp; stdcall fit libraries for mixed language compatibility <br>
  &ensp; extra options for count loss correction <br>
  &ensp; support for Red/Green and periods mode  <br>
  &ensp; option to use averaged log temperatures in fit tables <br>
  &ensp; data simulation <br>
  &ensp; laser logging <br>
  &ensp; rotating reference frame display <br>

Raw data formats currently recognised by WiMDA: <br>
  &ensp; ISIS: NEXUS, MACS and MCS format, i.e.current and archived data from MUSR/EMU/DEVA/HIFI/ARGUS/CHRONUS <br>
  &ensp; PSI: BIN format from GPS/LTF/GPD/DOLLY, MDU format from HAL9500, LEM data via conversion to BIN format <br>
  &ensp; KEK: pi port and mu port <br>
  &ensp; TRIUMF: TRI format <br>

Versions currently expire after 24 months; users should download a newer version at least every 24 months to keep up with bug fixes and new features.

A <a href=doc/wimda.pdf >paper</a> on WiMDA with screenshots was presented at the MUSR99 conference in Les Diablerets (August 30th - September 3rd 1999) and provides an overview of the program.

Please cite this paper as F.L. Pratt, Physica B 289-290, 710 (2000) when you refer to the use of the WiMDA data analysis program in a publication.
